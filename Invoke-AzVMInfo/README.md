## Overview  
The `Invoke-AzVMInfo.ps1` script is designed to automate the execution of commands across multiple Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). This script will use Role-Base Access Control (RBAC) access to query all VMs for associated Public IP addresses.  

## Prerequisites  
To use this script, you need the following:  

- **Az PowerShell SDK**: Authenticate with `Connect-AzAccount` before launching `Invoke-AzVMInfo.ps1`.
- **Azure RBAC Reader**: The identity to use with the `Az SDK` requires atleast "Reader" on the subscription(s), resource group(s), or resource(s) in-scope.
